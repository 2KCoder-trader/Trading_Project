Certainly! In this simulated stock trading game, you'll be trading specifically with the Microsoft Market. The game provides a visual representation of your trading actions on a graph.

To play the game, you interact with it by pressing keys on your keyboard. When you press the 's' key, it represents a sell action, and when you press the 'b' key, it represents a buy action. Each time you make a trade, a dot will appear on the display graph to indicate your action.

The graph shows the movement of the Microsoft stock price over time. As you make trades, the graph dynamically updates to reflect your buying and selling decisions. This allows you to see how your actions affect the stock price graphically.

Please note that this is a simulated game and does not involve real stock trading or real-time market data. It's designed for entertainment and educational purposes to provide a basic understanding of stock trading concepts.
